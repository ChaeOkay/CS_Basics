#Computer Science Programming Basics in Ruby 
###by Ophir Frieder, Gideon Frieder, and David Grossman


#####Extract from Preface
"Our target audience is students and practitioners who wish to learn
  computer science using Ruby rather than just how to program in a given
  language. This book consistently emphasizes why computer science is
  different from computer programming. Students and practitioners must
  understand what an algorithm is and what differentiates differing algorithms
  for the same task. Although we are living in an era of growing computational
  resources, we are also living in a world of growing data sets. Data amass
  every day; thus, efficient algorithms are needed to process these
  data."
